 <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
 <p class="large">  
  When you sign-up for a paid plan, a 30-day free trial is included.  If you cancel before the 30 days is up, you won't be charged.  The 30-day free trail is not available if you upgrade from the free plan. 
 </p>
 
 <h3>Is there a commitment?</h3>
 <p class="large">  
  No. Interval charges monthly.  Cancel at anytime. There are no sign-up fees, no long term contracts, and no cancelation fees.  
 </p>
 
 <h3>Change your plan at anytime.</h3>
 <p class="large">  
  Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at anytime. There are no extra fees.  The new charge will take effect on your next billing cycle.  If you cancel, you won't be charged again.  We do not prorate partial months and cannot issues refunds.
