  # Transactional fixtures accelerate your tests by wrapping each test method

  # test database remains unchanged so your fixtures don't have to be reloaded
  # between every test method.  Fewer database queries means faster tests.

  # don't care one way or the other, switching from MyISAM to InnoDB tables
